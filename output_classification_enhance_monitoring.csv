"I forgot, it points to the same thing and not a copy of it like in Python",monitor
I didn't realize there was no static keyword before the String type,monitor
I missed the colon instead of the curly brackets,monitor
I forgot to check my pointers.,monitor
It gets overwritten. I should have checked that because it's a static variable.,monitor
"I forgot to check pointer. Jim points to Dwight, so any changes to either will change the object for both pointers.",monitor
I misread this material.,monitor
The main module fulfills the role of a function.,monitor
I forgot to check my pointer.,monitor
"a and b point to the same value, until A changes",monitor
"We are specifically printing lime, not just anything",monitor
"I didn't know Java, so I couldn't print ints",monitor
I think b does not change the pointer from 43; I guess,monitor
"I'm not quite sure, actually.",monitor
I misunderstood Python syntax,monitor
"I thought referencing color or brand would confuse the code because it's a class variable, but it turns out that the method can change class variables since they were already declared.",monitor
I didn't think to look whether there was a print command in the code.,monitor
I didn't think that jan.jersey_number would also update when michael.jersey_number is increased,monitor
I encountered an error with bracket formatting.,monitor
I didn't think that forest.animal would also update.,monitor
I didn't realize that the brand was static,monitor
"I forgot, it points to the same thing and not a copy of it like in Python",monitor
"I thought since it had to be similar to Python code, we had to make a method to add the numbers",monitor
I'm unsure if I can call the `randomMethod()` function from `MyClass` since it's not a static method.,monitor
I misclicked.,monitor
I didn't pay enough attention to type declarations.,monitor
I did not notice that the func() method is non-static.,monitor
"I thought you needed to do this.add, but it makes sense given that it's inside the class. The only thing is I don't know what the point of 'this' is anymore outside of defining instance attributes and need clarification on its usage.",monitor
It doesn't work because webreg doesn't contain the function `information()`,monitor
Java non-static methods can't be referenced from a static context.,monitor
I didn't pay close enough attention to the for loop.,monitor
That's nuts. Using an int array will just remove the decimals.,monitor
The default value of a declared int is indeed 0!,monitor
"Bro, this is literally a type difference that's so mean.",monitor
"This is the place to write, why I think I got this question wrong :)",monitor
"I didn't do well on this test, I struggled with some questions.",monitor
I didn't realize the variables were named differently,monitor
I got confused between color and calories.,monitor
I didn't realize I wasn't calling printPersonInfo().,monitor
I didn't use semicolons,monitor
"I didn't declare x, y, or z as integers.",monitor
I just straight up didn't read this thoroughly.,monitor
You don't have to @Override. You should also consider @Equals and @Hashcode.,monitor
I'm struggling to grasp how Generics work,monitor
I am not sure if the default int is always 0.,monitor
The class can't implement the methods,monitor
Is the object also in the Super Shape?,monitor
No return type is needed. I did not see 'return' keyword.,monitor
The line needed is: Apple.newRevenue = Apple.basicRevenue + Apple.changeRevenue;,monitor
"I didn't do well overall. I struggled with some concepts, like pointer check and memory management. To improve, I will review notes and take practice problems.",monitor
"I struggled with some topics, particularly advanced data structures. I need to review these topics more thoroughly and practice implementing algorithms.",monitor
"I simply did not know the definition of overloading in Java, which is when a single parameter name is used with different data types.",monitor
,monitor
"I didn't realize that A was true, but it makes sense given that interfaces are specifically designed for inheritance",monitor
"The variable T needs to be declared before usage, not 'in front of' voice.",monitor
"DSC 30 extends webreg, but webreg does not extend DSC 30",monitor
I'm not sure why I need @Override?,monitor
"I thought they pointed to the same box, so it changes for both variables.",monitor
I didn't understand,monitor
The variable is static.,monitor
I am confused,monitor
I need to implement each method thoroughly.,monitor
interface is not a class,monitor
I'm confused,monitor
I misread,monitor
I misread,monitor
I really think this is just wrong???,monitor
"basically, it's the same as what I did before.",monitor
I struggled with this test,monitor
"Interfaces aren't classes, they are a subset of classes.",monitor
"Interfaces are not classes, they define behavior",monitor
I thought this was only for instance variables.,monitor
"I missed that fruitInfo.getCalories() should return 0, not null, given this input.",monitor
"Variables x and y do not have a type declared, which is incorrect.",monitor
"When initializing the car objects, I ensure that each object is pointing to a unique address. When printing the object information from the two different addresses, this detail should be noted.",monitor
"I didn't catch this - it's a reference type, and it will change.",monitor
"I realized I need to be careful with reference types, especially when they change.",monitor
I should make a change to reference.,monitor
I don't understand this answer. The strings printed are not even in the class.,monitor
line3: parameter is an integer.,monitor
Line 3: Method header \<T\>,monitor
line3: Method header<T>,monitor
I forgot to check pointer on line 3: method header<T>,monitor
line3: method parameter <T>,monitor
An integer will have 0 as its default value,monitor
"Uses implements, and an interface is just an interface.",monitor
The system is missing an 'S'.,monitor
Wrong initialization. I should have initialized DSC30 as 'dsc30_fall22' instead of 'new Webreg();',monitor
The course name should be Webreg<CourseName> instead of DSC30<CourseName>.,monitor
This is protected in parent class which can't be used in the subclass.,monitor
Use a method from the parent class.,monitor
The variable water_percent is protected,monitor
Because the class did not implement properly,monitor
"str has "" not '",monitor
"I did well on questions that required understanding of data structures, but struggled with algorithms and implementations. I will review the code examples more carefully to understand the logic better.",monitor
instance variable without value returns NaN,monitor
I'm not sure why.,monitor
"It still doesn't work huh, but that makes sense given the values of everything inside ArrayList is T. However, if the list typing is String then that probably wouldn't work.",monitor
"I think, but technically, interfaces aren't classes right",monitor
I made a mistake by misreading,monitor
"So is it because it's constrained to the definitions of the functions inside of webreg, it can still use DSC30's version? I need to ask more about this in OH.",monitor
I didn't know how the instance is being accessed,monitor
Didn't know that ints get default initializations of 0.,monitor
"I thought I saw ""protected"" instead of ""public"" for color and brand",monitor
I wasn't reading,monitor
I need to review static stuff again,monitor
What does arrayEquals and new[] mean?,monitor
"Do integers not serve as pointers? I guess that makes sense, lol.",monitor
"Oh, obviously, if the condition is false, then there would be no return statement. LOL.",monitor
Private variables are not accessible outside of the class. I should remember that.,monitor
I initially believed age should be treated as a class attribute here,monitor
"I thought that leg_count would err since it's not declared, but it is in fact declared just not set to an initial value.",monitor
The function is not declared as static,monitor
must declare the return type,monitor
"I completely missed the catch for arithmetic exceptions, so I assumed they weren't there.",monitor
"I assumed that when you call an ArrayList of a generic type, you also have to specify the kind of parameter it is.",monitor
I looked at wrong,monitor
Get car info is a static function,monitor
"This function is a non-static method, so if we want to call it, we need to create an object first",monitor
The water percentage is a private variable.,monitor
I didn't see the 'static'},monitor
I didn't know that this is the error that's thrown,monitor
"The null check was correct, but the result should be false.",monitor
"I thought this would create an error because the function is adding an int and another int, which should return an int not a float, which would result in an error for add().",monitor
you're driving me crazy,monitor
"Classes don't work the same as setting integers equal to each other. Here, when Jerry equals Tom, they always point at the same thing.",monitor
"I got a score, super() was correct.",monitor
"protected, private, earth",monitor
ageUp() function takes a parameter as pass.,monitor
Interface is not a class,monitor
Static variable is shared by whole class,monitor
I made a mistake,monitor
"It contains static, which makes it so that it permanently changes the variables.",monitor
It's good.,monitor
I forgot to check for static in the getCarInfo method.,monitor
Isn't overloading multiple methods that have the same name with different parameters,monitor
I thought it would throw an exception that would be caught by the try-catch block,monitor
I clicked the wrong answer.,monitor
I didn't know if an interface can extend another one.,monitor
I assumed they have the same meaning,monitor
I read the code incorrectly,monitor
"I think the answer is false; T is not declared in the class name, the code won't work.",monitor
I got a chance question because the String[] isn't there,monitor
I'm not sure if both options are correct.,monitor
I missed that there was no <T> after the static keyword in line three.,monitor
Abstract Java classes can have instance variables,monitor
Type casting from int to float after multiplication.,monitor
I realized there should be a public static String[].,monitor
"I believe Professor is called without any parameters, and with parameters, it needs to use this() method.",monitor
It does not have static in its double new revenue.,monitor
Because new revenue isn't static.,monitor
"Since ingredient 2 contains a static, it is built-in within the system and can continue running.",monitor
I just didn't read the school sections and only looked at the numbers; I will review those next time.,monitor
"The keyword is 'extends', not 'interfaces', but the rest was true. I forgot to consider that.",monitor
I assumed 0 to be considered as null.,monitor
review in order,monitor
I got it right,monitor
This is indeed correct,monitor
I didn't realize I made an error,monitor
"I thought it was an error, but I need to review my code again.",monitor
I'm really surprised that this is wrong.,monitor
"Remember that each tree in a merge sort algorithm doesn't run in parallel, rather it runs per each tree, meaning that it will only need the space of a single tree for each iteration at any given point, which ends up being O(N).",monitor
"Oh, duh!",monitor
I did not realize that there is a recursion that happens before the print statement.,monitor
"5 is smaller than 6, but it seems on a lower level than 6",monitor
I noticed more values under 1000 than values divisible by 20.,monitor
"I forgot about the completeness property of heap. If I delete a node, something needs to replace it to maintain the parent-child relationship from left to right completeness property.",monitor
"This doesn't make any sense, I need to ask my tutor.",monitor
"I wouldn't put e at the start of the sorted array, that would result in an ascending sorted array. Instead I would put it at the end of the sorted array.",monitor
"I didn't do very well on this test. I struggled with some concepts, but I will review the material again to better understand where I went wrong and how to improve for next time.",monitor
I believe O(nlog(n)) has a greater time complexity than O(n).,monitor
I thought about part D and meant to put E at the beginning of the sorted part.,monitor
It would be very useful to provide solutions. I don't understand why you would get a false positive,monitor
"Yeah, just study the hashes and stuff.",monitor
I misread my notesheet,monitor
I didn't read the head.next.next carefully enough.,monitor
"I should take a note that ok, I will test the array size next time",monitor
"For selection sort, you first check if the length is nonzero. Then find the smallest element. Put it at the end and reduce the length by one.",monitor
"I struggled with some concepts, but I did well on others. In particular, I need to review my understanding of pointers and memory management.",monitor
I didn't do well. I need to review more.,monitor
I missed that line,monitor
Didn't consider all the changes that need to be noted,monitor
"I realized that if 8 doesn't move, it shouldn't count. I should also look for similar hesitations on the exam.",monitor
I finally understand now. Only knew how to delete the root node before.,monitor
I think the answer is wrong,monitor
"I didn't do well on this test, but I'll review my notes for the next one. ",monitor
I forgot,monitor
"I picked this answer, but for some reason it didn't go through?",monitor
Not correct here,monitor
I guess you would be able to use both,monitor
"I did well on some questions, but struggled with others.",monitor
I did not remember about type specifications,monitor
