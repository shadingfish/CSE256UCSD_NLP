140	416	I forgot it points to the same thing and not a copy of it like in python	01/17/2023 13:13:41
140	252	didn't realize there was no static in front of String	01/17/2023 13:16:08
140	224	Missed the colon instead of the curly brackets	01/17/2023 13:16:24
140	248	pointer check	01/17/2023 13:16:38
140	243	It gets overwrited? What because it's static?	01/17/2023 13:17:46
140	419	pointer check. Jim points to dwight so any changes to either change the object for both pointers	01/17/2023 13:18:42
140	235	I misread this	01/17/2023 13:19:42
140	223	Main fulfills the role of function?	01/17/2023 13:20:31
140	422	pointer check	01/17/2023 13:20:38
144	401	a and b point to the same value, until a chages	01/18/2023 00:21:14
144	227	We are printing lime specifically not just anything	01/18/2023 00:22:25
144	226	I didn't know java and print ints	01/18/2023 00:23:39
144	410	b doesn't change pointer from 43, I guess	01/18/2023 00:24:48
144	257	I'm not sure actually	01/18/2023 00:25:58
149	233	misunderstand Python syntax	01/18/2023 10:44:49
156	248	I thought that referencing color or brand would confuse the code because it's a class variable, but it turns out that the method can change class variables because they were already declared.	01/18/2023 11:10:24
38	254	I didn't think to look whether there was a print command in the code	01/18/2023 11:38:47
38	416	I didn't think that jan.jersey_number would also update when michael.jersey_number was increased	01/18/2023 11:39:36
38	224	Error regarding bracket formatting	01/18/2023 11:40:16
38	420	I didn't think that forrest.animal would also update	01/18/2023 11:45:49
38	250	I didn't see that brand is static	01/18/2023 11:47:09
140	416	I forgot it points to the same thing and not a copy of it like in python	01/18/2023 11:56:52
158	226	I thought since it had to be similar to the python code we had to make a method to add the numbers	01/19/2023 19:11:54
161	253	Unsure that you could call randomMethod() from MyClass as it wasn't a static method	01/19/2023 21:55:31
161	240	Misclicked	01/19/2023 21:55:44
161	231	Didn't pay attention to type declarations 	01/19/2023 21:56:34
176	252	I did not notice that the func() method was non-static.	01/27/2023 13:49:26
140	225	I thought you needed to do this.add, but it makes sense given that it's inside the class. The only thing is I don't know what the point of "this" is anymore outside of defining instance attributes	01/30/2023 09:34:18
140	397	Ohhhhh, it doesn't work because webreg doesn't contain information()	01/30/2023 09:35:02
125	210	Java non-static methods cannot be referenced from static context!	01/30/2023 15:27:03
140	759	didn't pay close enough attention to the for loop	02/01/2023 07:35:14
140	215	that's nuts. So using an int array must just get rid of the decimals	02/01/2023 07:35:48
140	384	oooohhhhhh, the default value of a declared int is 0!	02/01/2023 07:37:30
140	325	bro this is literally a type difference that's so mean	02/01/2023 07:38:12
47	626	this is the place to write why I think I got this question wrong :) 	02/01/2023 15:01:35
140	766	rip	02/04/2023 11:55:05
140	386	didn't realize the variables were named differently	02/04/2023 11:55:42
140	264	confused get color and calories	02/04/2023 15:40:00
140	324	didn't realize that it wasn't printPersonInfo()	02/04/2023 15:41:10
140	230	no semi-colons lol	02/04/2023 15:41:29
140	225	didn't declare x, y, or z as integers	02/05/2023 07:46:26
140	765	I just straight up didn't read this	02/05/2023 07:47:16
140	380	you don't have to @Override?	02/05/2023 07:47:57
168	762	I don't really understand how Generics work	02/05/2023 10:34:28
168	389	Is the default int just 0?	02/05/2023 10:35:04
168	328	The class cannot implement the methods	02/05/2023 10:39:34
168	766	Is object also in the super Shape?	02/05/2023 11:21:48
195	237	no return type needed (did not see "type")	02/05/2023 11:31:58
195	339	line needed: Apple.newRevenue = Apple.basicRevenue + Apple.changeRevenue;	02/05/2023 13:10:04

199	766	??	02/05/2023 15:26:04
176	332	I simply did not know the definition of overloading in Java.	02/05/2023 18:24:23

156	612	misread	02/06/2023 20:31:16
156	605	I think this is just wrong???	02/06/2023 20:34:00
156	381	basically the same like what	02/06/2023 20:36:03
156	379	trolled	02/06/2023 20:36:21
156	376	interfaces aren't classes	02/06/2023 21:24:15
156	375	interfaces aren't classes	02/06/2023 21:24:22
156	393	thought this. was only for instance variables	02/06/2023 21:24:59
176	270	I missed that fruitInfo.getCalories should return 0, not null, given this input.	02/06/2023 21:46:14
184	226	Variables x and y do not have a type declared.	02/06/2023 22:40:26
191	245	when initializing the car objects the addresses each object is pointing to should be different. when printing the object info information from the two different addresses should be printed	02/06/2023 22:45:34

195	421	reference type; change reference	02/06/2023 22:45:59
191	387	I don't get this answer. The strings printed are not even in the class	02/06/2023 22:49:22

168	376	uses implements, and an interface is just an interface	02/06/2023 23:23:49
168	381	the System is missing an S	02/06/2023 23:24:37
195	397	wrong initialize: DSC30 dsc30_fall22 = new Webreg();	02/06/2023 23:31:51
195	392	Webreg.CourseName not DSC30.CourseName	02/06/2023 23:32:38
195	387	protected in parent class cannot be used in subclass	02/06/2023 23:33:30

195	391	water_percent is protected	02/06/2023 23:34:49
168	377	because the class didn't implement properly	02/06/2023 23:41:23
183	222	str has " " not ' '	02/07/2023 00:33:08
172	257	???	02/07/2023 01:02:14
183	339	instance variable without value gives nan	02/07/2023 01:48:41
214	257	why	02/07/2023 03:56:30
140	763	it still doesn't work huh but that makes sense given the values of everything inside of ArrayList is T, but if the list typing is String then that probably wouldn't work.	02/07/2023 07:38:00
140	238	I guess? But interfaces technically aren't classes right	02/07/2023 07:41:27
140	266	misread	02/07/2023 07:41:50
140	396	So is it because it's constrained to the definitions of the functions inside of webreg, it can still use DSC30's version? I need to ask more about this in OH	02/07/2023 07:54:55
215	339	I didn't know how the instance was accessed	02/07/2023 10:01:51
215	389	Didn't know ints got default initializations of 0	02/07/2023 10:28:06
215	244	I thought I saw protected instead of public for color and brand	02/07/2023 10:29:17
156	373	Wasn't reading	02/07/2023 12:17:37
156	253	Gotta go back to static stuf	02/07/2023 12:17:52
156	261	wtf is arrayequals and what is new[]	02/07/2023 12:18:26
216	410	do integers not serve as pointers? I guess that makes sense lol	02/07/2023 12:23:30
216	208	oh obviously if the condition is false then there would be no return statement lol	02/07/2023 12:24:01
144	391	Private variables are not accessible outside of the class	02/07/2023 13:45:20
144	380	I thought age is a class attribute here	02/07/2023 13:47:38
144	384	I thought that leg_count would error since it's not declared, but it is in fact declared just not set to an initial value	02/07/2023 13:53:50
144	251	func() is not static	02/07/2023 13:55:38
131	229	must declare return type	02/07/2023 15:13:29
217	216	Just completely missed the catch arithmetic exception e so I answered assuming that wasn't there.	02/07/2023 16:50:30
213	753	I assumed when you called an Arraylist of a generic type you also had to specify what kind of parameter it is	02/07/2023 17:44:00
183	244	看错	02/07/2023 18:11:23
183	247	get car info is static function	02/07/2023 18:12:38
91	256	func is non static method so if we want to call this method we should create an object first	02/07/2023 19:26:19
91	391	water_percentage is private variable	02/07/2023 19:27:28
213	338	didn't see the 'static'	02/07/2023 20:33:58
213	209	didn't know that this is the error that is thrown	02/07/2023 20:34:30
183	266	assertNull(0) is true	02/07/2023 20:53:53
222	215	I thought this would create an error because the function is adding an int and another int, which should return an int not a float, which would result in an error for add(). 	02/07/2023 21:07:10
183	386	你在逗我	02/07/2023 21:44:29
207	414	Classes do not work the same as setting integers equal to each other. Here, when jerry = tom they point at the same thing always	02/07/2023 21:51:20
183	390	super()	02/07/2023 21:52:49
183	391	protected private earth	02/07/2023 21:53:25
183	381	ageUp() has parameter pass in.	02/07/2023 22:47:06
131	376	interface is not a class	02/07/2023 22:47:28
183	378	static for class attribute	02/07/2023 22:49:29
183	374	看错	02/07/2023 22:51:58
163	245	it contain static. Static makes it so that it permantelty changes the variables. 	02/07/2023 23:26:45
163	258	it's good	02/07/2023 23:27:02
163	247	it has static in the getcarinfo	02/07/2023 23:27:23
193	332	???? Isn't overloading multiple methods that have the same name with different parameters	02/08/2023 00:29:55
204	216	I thought it would throw an exception that would be caught by the try catch block	02/08/2023 03:46:57
129	204	clicked the wrong answer	02/08/2023 04:36:44
149	374	didn't know if an interface can extend another one	02/08/2023 06:22:44
149	333	assumed these two have the same meaning	02/08/2023 06:24:33
149	262	read the code wrong	02/08/2023 06:26:15
149	753	I think the answer is false, <T> is not declared in the class name, the code won't work	02/08/2023 06:27:31
140	347	gatcha question cuz the String[] isn't there	02/08/2023 09:01:32
161	329	Both work?	02/08/2023 09:02:09
176	762	I missed that there was no <T> after the static keyword in line three.	02/08/2023 09:07:40
161	374	Abstract java classes can have instance variables 	02/08/2023 09:13:46
191	215	typecast from int multiplication to float?	02/08/2023 09:15:05
163	333	There must be public static String[]	02/08/2023 10:53:32
163	344	Professor with no parameter, supers. With a parameter, needs to use this(). I believe so.	02/08/2023 10:54:08
163	339	It does not have static in its Double new revenue. 	02/08/2023 10:57:39
185	339	because newRevenue isn't static	02/08/2023 10:58:26
163	337	Since ingredient 2, contains a static. It is built in within the system and can continue running. 	02/08/2023 11:01:49
146	414	I just didn't read the school sections and only looked at the numbers.	02/08/2023 11:14:54
146	376	The keyword is extends, not interfaces, but the rest was true. I forgot about that.	02/08/2023 11:15:41
149	264	assumed 0 to be considered as null	02/08/2023 11:36:20
182	645	Review in order	02/22/2023 04:02:12
182	641	I got it correct	02/22/2023 04:24:35
182	641	This is correct	02/22/2023 12:25:29
33	756	I didn't realize it wasn't an error	02/22/2023 13:49:49
33	758	I thought it was an error	02/22/2023 13:49:57
33	645	Wow I can't believe this is wrong	02/22/2023 13:50:25
140	615	remember that each tree in a merge sort algorithm doesn't run in parallel, rather it runs per each tree, meaning that it will only need the space of a single tree for each iteration in at any given point, which ends up being O(N)	02/27/2023 07:03:35
140	521	oh duh	02/27/2023 07:04:00
168	517	did not realize there is a recursion that happens before the print statement	03/05/2023 16:43:48
168	660	5 is smaller than 6, but it appears on a lower level than 6	03/05/2023 16:44:49
140	693	More values under 1000 than values divisible by 20	03/05/2023 20:40:46
140	667	Forgot about completeness property of heap. If 11 is deleted something needs to replace it to maintain the parent child from left to right completeness property	03/05/2023 20:42:39
140	522	This makes no sense, ask tutor	03/05/2023 20:44:58
140	606	I wouldn't put e at the start of the sorted array, that would end in an ascending sorted array. Instead I would put it at the end of the sorted array	03/05/2023 20:48:23
136	700	Haven	03/06/2023 05:08:15
136	610	Thought O(nlog(n)) had greater time complexity than (O(n))	03/06/2023 05:08:52
136	606	Thought part d. meant putting e at the beginning of the sorted part	03/06/2023 05:09:12
191	701	Would be useful to provide solutions. Don't get how you would get false positive	03/06/2023 09:25:15
136	720	Yea, just study the hashes and stuff	03/06/2023 20:05:59
136	599	Misread notesheet	03/06/2023 22:20:51
136	516	Didn't read the head.next.next carefully enough	03/06/2023 22:23:02
136	600	Ok, just test the array size next time	03/06/2023 22:30:30
163	606	for selection sort, you first check if the length is nonzero. Then find the smallest element. Put e at the end . and reduce the length by one,	03/07/2023 14:27:18
206	642	???	03/07/2023 16:19:53
201	636	none	03/07/2023 16:38:25
229	762	missed that line	03/07/2023 16:52:27
136	607	Didn't consider all changes should be noted	03/07/2023 20:29:56
136	603	Thought because 8 didn't move it didn't count. Could clarify a similar hesitation on the exam.	03/07/2023 20:33:06
136	670	Ok, I get it know. Only knew how to delete the root node before.	03/07/2023 20:33:28
149	608	?the answer is wrong	03/08/2023 10:30:43
149	664	???????	03/08/2023 10:32:09
140	628	lol I forgot	03/08/2023 10:59:07
140	641	I picked this answer but for some reason it \\didn't go through?	03/08/2023 10:59:52
156	642	Literally not correct here	03/08/2023 11:41:51
140	766	I guess you'd be able to use both	03/10/2023 05:31:38
140	391	private	03/10/2023 05:32:07
33	236	I did not remember about type specification	03/30/2023 12:25:21
